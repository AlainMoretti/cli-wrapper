This is a plain text file

Its purpose is to show how you can encrypt/decrypt files
containing embedded passwords and other critical stuff
using "cipher.py" utility. 

Its ciphered counterpart "plaintext.enc" password is "password"
So you can test the decrypt function of "cipher.py" as well...
